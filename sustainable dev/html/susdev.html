    <h1>Sustainable Development</h1>
    <p><b>Sustainable development</b> is an organizing principle that aims to meet human development goals while also
        enabling natural systems to provide necessary natural resources and ecosystem services to humans. The desired
        result is a society where living conditions and resources meet human needs without undermining the planetary
        integrity and stability of the natural system. The Brundtland Report in 1987 defined sustainable development as
        "development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future
        generations to meet their own needs". The concept of sustainable development nowadays has a focus on economic
        development, social development and environmental protection for future generations.
    </p>
    <p>Sustainable development was first institutionalized with the Rio Process initiated at the 1992 Earth Summit in
        Rio de Janeiro. In 2015 the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted the Sustainable Development Goals
        (2015 to 2030) and explained how the goals are integrated and indivisible to achieve sustainable development at
        the global level. The UNGA's 17 goals address the global challenges, including poverty, inequality, climate
        change, environmental degradation, peace, and justice.</p>
    <p>Sustainable development is interlinked with the normative concept of sustainability. UNESCO formulated a
        distinction between the two concepts as follows: "Sustainability is often thought of as a long-term goal (i.e. a
        more sustainable world), while sustainable development refers to the many processes and pathways to achieve it."
        The concept of sustainable development has been criticized in various ways. While some see it as paradoxical (or
        as an oxymoron) and regard development as inherently unsustainable, others are disappointed in the lack of
        progress that has been achieved so far.Part of the problem is that "development" itself is not consistently
        defined.</p>

                        dimensions, putting <i>environment</i> as the foundation for the

            Sustainability is a
            societal goal that relates to the ability of people to safely co-exist on Earth over a long time. Specific
            definitions of this term are difficult to agree on and have varied with
            literature, context, and time.
            Sustainability is commonly described as having three dimensions (or pillars):
            environmental, economic, and social.Many
            publications state that the environmental dimension is the most important.
            For this
            reason, in everyday use, <i>sustainability</i> is often focused on countering
            major environmental problems, such as climate
            change, loss of biodiversity, loss
            of title="Ecosystem service"ecosystem
            services, land
            degradation, and air and water pollution. The concept of sustainability
            can be used to guide decisions at the global, national, and individual levels
            (e.g. sustainable
            living).

    <h2>Development of the concept</h2>
    <p>Sustainable development has its roots in ideas regarding sustainable forest management, which were developed in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries.In response to a growing awareness of the depletion of timber resources in England, John Evelyn argued, in his 1662 essay Sylva, that "sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner, in order to stop the destructive over-exploitation of natural resources." In 1713, Hans Carl von Carlowitz, a senior mining administrator in the service of Elector Frederick Augustus I of Saxony published Sylvicultura economics, a 400-page work on forestry. Building upon the ideas of Evelyn and French minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, von Carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for sustained yield.His work influenced others, including Alexander von Humboldt and Georg Ludwig Hartig, eventually leading to the development of the science of forestry. This, in turn, influenced people like Gifford Pinchot, the first head of the US Forest Service, whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources, and Aldo Leopold whose land ethic was influential in the development of the environmental movement in the 1960s.</p>
    <p>Following the publication of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring in 1962, the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation. Kenneth E. Boulding, in his influential 1966 essay The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth, identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system with its limited pools of resources. Another milestone was the 1968 article by Garrett Hardin that popularized the term "tragedy of the commons". One of the first uses of the term sustainable in the contemporary sense was by the Club of Rome in 1972 in its classic report on the Limits to Growth, written by a group of scientists led by Dennis and Donella Meadows of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Describing the desirable "state of global equilibrium", the authors wrote: "We are searching for a model output that represents a world system that is sustainable without sudden and uncontrolled collapse and capable of satisfying the basic material requirements of all of its people."That year also saw the publication of the influential book, A Blueprint for Survival.</p>
    <p>In 1975, an <a href="https://www.mit.edu/">MIT</a> research group prepared ten days of hearings on "Growth and Its Implication for the Future" for the US Congress, the first hearings ever held on sustainable development.</p>
    <p>In 1980, the International Union for Conservation of Nature published a world conservation strategy that included one of the first references to sustainable development as a global priority and introduced the term "sustainable development". Two years later, the United Nations World Charter for Nature raised five principles of conservation by which human conduct affecting nature is to be guided and judged.</p>
    <p>Since the Brundtland Report, the concept of sustainable development has developed beyond the initial intergenerational framework to focus more on the goal of "socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth". In 1992, the UN Conference on Environment and Development published the Earth Charter, which outlines the building of a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. The action plan Agenda 21 for sustainable development identified information, integration, and participation as key building blocks to help countries achieve development that recognizes these interdependent pillars. Furthermore, Agenda 21 emphasizes that broad public participation in decision-making is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development.</p>
    <p>The Rio Protocol was a huge leap forward: for the first time, the world agreed on a sustainability agenda. In fact, a global consensus was facilitated by neglecting concrete goals and operational details. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) now have concrete targets (unlike the results from the Rio Process) but no methods for sanctions.</p>
    <h2>Dimensions</h2>
    <p>Sustainable development, like sustainability, is regarded to have three dimensions (also called pillars, domains, aspects, spheres and globalized etc.): the environment, economy and society.</p>
    <p>Scholars usually distinguish three different areas of sustainability. These are the environmental, the social, and the economic. Several terms are in use for this concept. Authors may speak of three pillars, dimensions, components, aspects, perspectives, factors, or goals. All mean the same thing in this context. The three dimensions paradigm has few theoretical foundations. It emerged without a single point of origin. Scholars rarely question the distinction itself. The idea of sustainability with three dimensions is a dominant interpretation in the literature.</p>
    <p>Countries could develop systems for monitoring and evaluation of progress towards achieving sustainable development by adopting indicators that measure changes across economic, social and environmental dimensions.</p>
    <h2>Critique</h2>
    <p>The concept of sustainable development has been and still is, subject to criticism, including the question of what is to be sustained in sustainable development. It has been argued that there is no such thing as sustainable use of a non-renewable resource, since any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to the exhaustion of earth's finite stock; this perspective renders the Industrial Revolution as a whole unsustainable.</p>

       <p> The sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital (economic, social, and natural), which may be non-substitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible. Natural capital can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital. While it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources, it is much less likely that they will ever be able to replace ecosystem services, such as the protection provided by the ozone layer, or the climate stabilizing function of the Amazonian forest.</p>
        
        <p>The concept of sustainable development has been criticized from different angles. While some see it as paradoxical (or an oxymoron) and regard development as inherently unsustainable, others are disappointed in the lack of progress that has been achieved so far. Part of the problem is that "development" itself is not consistently defined.</p>
        
        <p>The vagueness of the Brundtland definition of sustainable development has been criticized as follows:The definition has "opened up the possibility of downplaying sustainability. Hence, governments spread the message that we can have it all at the same time, i.e. economic growth, prospering societies and a healthy environment. No new ethic is required. This so-called weak version of sustainability is popular among governments, and businesses, but profoundly wrong and not even weak, as there is no alternative to preserving the earth's ecological integrity.</p>
